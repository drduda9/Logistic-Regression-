# Logistic-Regression-

# This is an exercise to implement learned knowledge of Logistic Regression models on the 2011 National Health Interview Survey. The exercise is intended to predict if someone worked based upon age and marital status. Taking this a step further, the model is then used to predict the probability of working for each level of marital status.
